# C_Expanding_Array

After further learning I realize this implementation in mian.c and ExpandArray.c are not functional and because of the nature of memory allocation to arrays in C. (I believe this implementation would work for C++ as I remember doing something similair in the past.)
I won't be modifying this to forcibly reallocate memory as you would have to to make an implementation like this work, as there are issues with doing so in real world applications.
Please see implenations of data structures in C for arraylist, linked list etc
