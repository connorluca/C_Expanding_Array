# C_Expanding_Array

After further learning I realize this implementation in mian.c and ExpandArray.c are not functional and because of the nature of memory allocation to arrays in C. (I believe this implementation would work for C++ as I remember doing something similair in the past.)
I may add an implementation for something similair to an arraylist here later or create a new project to store it in.
